  <h1>Main Course Menu Items</h1>
  <h2>Discussions</h2>
  <p>In the discussions there are all the discussions list, with the topic well divided. You can see the unread messages in blue close to the number on entries in that discussion topic. You may post questions here and the assignments.</p>
  <h2>Quizzes</h2>
  <p>It's where all the quizzes are located. It's kind of confusing still because the quizzes are not in order, so I have to look but the number of the quizzes. Also, there's no due dates visible. You may take the quizzes weekly or have them finished by the end of the semester.</p>
  <h2>Assignments</h2>
  <p>This is where all the assignments for the week are suppose to be in. The first week of assignments were in there and it helped me to keep track of my progress until I completed all of the assignments. You are suppose to do the weekly assignments in here and keep track of them.</p>
  <h1>Other Three Items</h1>
  <h2>Course Tools</h2>
  <p>This dropdown menu have the tools necessary to find the announcements, groups, blog and others. It's a very easy way to the tools used in the course. Like the Blog, it's very intuite to find it, but the blog itself still confusing. I don't know how to see blog entries from another person.</p>
  <h2>Grades</h2>
  <p>This page has all the grades. It shows the graded assignments and the ones in blank.</p>
  <h2>Class List</h2>
  <p>This page has all the people taking this course. You can send email directly to one of them. Very good to get in touch with anyone in this class.</p>
